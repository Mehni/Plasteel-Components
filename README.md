# Plasteel Components

Vanilla RimWorld lacks a plasteel sink. There isn't all that much use for it if you don't use traps or turrets. After a few visits from the friendly neighbourhood mechanoid faction, colonies can be sitting on mountains of plasteel, hoping for a hapless trader to unload it unto. Plasteel components aim to provide a reliable method of disposing of excess plasteel.

**Compatibility notes:**

Save to add and remove from existing save-games, provided you delete the bill prior to uninstalling.

**Balance notes:**

Using this mod reduces the need for steel and drains your plasteel supply. Using plasteel for component assembly effectively reduces your wealth since it's one of the more expensive materials available.
